# RealTalk - SSE Backend Project

## üéØ Project Goal (Phase 1 - MVP)

Build a minimal backend system that supports real-time public messaging using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. Users can post and view messages in real-time. This iteration focuses on backend-only implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration (Optional for MVP)**
   - Allow users to register with a simple username (no authentication for MVP).
   - Alternatively, generate a random user ID on message submission.

2. **Post Message Endpoint**
   - `POST /messages`
   - Accepts a message and sender name or ID.
   - Stores messages in an in-memory store (or lightweight DB like SQLite/Postgres if needed).

3. **Real-Time Feed with SSE**
   - `GET /events`
   - Clients connect to receive a continuous stream of new messages.
   - Support multiple concurrent SSE clients.

4. **Message Broadcasting**
   - New messages should be broadcast immediately to all connected SSE clients.

5. **Retrieve Recent Messages (Optional)**
   - `GET /messages`
   - Returns the last N messages for new clients or UI rendering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Simplicity**
   - Keep the codebase minimal and clean.
   - Prefer Go standard libraries for implementation.

2. **Performance (Basic)**
   - Handle at least 50 concurrent SSE clients without performance degradation.

3. **Reliability**
   - Handle client disconnects and reconnections gracefully.
   - Prevent crashes on malformed or invalid input.

4. **Maintainability**
   - Follow layered architecture:
     - Handler ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository (if persistence is used)
   - Use environment variables or config files for configuration.

5. **Observability**
   - Log key events:
     - New message posted
     - New SSE client connected/disconnected
     - Errors or edge cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Persistence:** In-memory (or SQLite/Postgres for optional DB support)
- **Real-time:** Server-Sent Events using Go's `http.ResponseWriter` with `Flush()`
- **Logging:** Standard `log` package or `uber-go/zap` for structured logging

## üöÄ Next Steps

- [ ] Setup project scaffold with Go modules
- [ ] Implement message model and in-memory storage
- [ ] Add `/messages` POST and `/events` SSE endpoint
- [ ] Add simple logging
- [ ] Test with multiple clients
